This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.8.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

`ng build --base-href="https://M8mueller.github.io/salvage-union-mech-garage/"`

Then copy the contents of `/dist/salvage-union-mech-garage/browser` into `/docs` and update all the `*.css` and `*.js` files to point to `/salvage-union-mech-garage/*`.
